1. THANK YOU  ================================================================

This is my first program that I've put out for other people to see. THis being
said, it sucks. A lot. But hey, it's a start. Thanks for downloading it and
testing it for me. Naturally, it has quite a long way to go. But I'll fix it
up and make it look better.


2. HOW YOU CAN HELP ==========================================================

You can...
	-Run and play the game. There are instructions in the game, and I tried
	 to make it pretty "idiotproof." You aren't idiots, but you never know.
	-Let me know if you find any bugs. Just message me on facebook or 
	 email me or something. 
	-Give me a pat on the back and lie blatantly about how much you love 
	 playing this game.

3. HOW TO RUN IT =============================================================

You'll need Java. Make sure you have it. If you don't, get it here:
http://www.java.com/en/

Then, just run the .jar file. That's it. 
And then tell me about all the bugs. That's really it. 

4. THAT'S... THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT, ACTUALLY. ================================
Thanks again.
